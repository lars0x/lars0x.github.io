[{"content":"A personal experiment Welcome to Lars\u0026rsquo;s corner!\nThis place is a big personal experiment, and I\u0026rsquo;m happy you\u0026rsquo;re here at the start of it.\nOver the coming weeks and months, I will slowly be building out this corner of the internet to reflect everything going on inside my mind. From random thoughts to deeply-researched topics, from how-to-guides to commentary on global events - nothing is off the table.\nIf there is any topic you wish to hear my thoughts on, do let me know.\nFormats There are two formats in which I will share my thoughts with you.\nThe first will be in blog form, the same as you are reading now. These posts will generally be longer and more in-depth. I\u0026rsquo;m not yet committing to a writing schedule, but you can expect some consistency in the pace at which these come out.\nThe second format is my digital garden. This is a wild garden where I loosely tend to ideas and thoughts, and can best be described as my attempt to form a cohesive model of the world. Content will be added here on an ad-hoc basis.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get started I\u0026rsquo;m excited to go on this journey with you. If you\u0026rsquo;re interested, please bookmark this site and check back later. A place to sign up for email updates will follow soon.\nWhether this place will be found by many people or not, my hope is that you will find some value in the things that I write.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s get started!\n","permalink":"http://lars.engineer/post/welcome/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"a-personal-experiment\"\u003eA personal experiment\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWelcome to Lars\u0026rsquo;s corner!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis place is a big personal experiment, and I\u0026rsquo;m happy you\u0026rsquo;re here at the start of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the coming weeks and months, I will slowly be building out this corner of the internet to reflect everything going on inside my mind.\nFrom random thoughts to deeply-researched topics, from how-to-guides to commentary on global events - nothing is off the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf there is any topic you wish to hear my thoughts on, \u003ca href=\"https://t.me/lars0x\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003edo let me know\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Welcome to Lars's corner!"},{"content":"COMING SOON\nThis section will be my personal digital garden, a space where I freely tend to thoughts and ideas.\nPlease sit tight as I port this over from Notion to here.\n","permalink":"http://lars.engineer/garden/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eCOMING SOON\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis section will be my personal \u003ca href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003edigital garden\u003c/a\u003e, a space where I freely tend to thoughts and ideas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease sit tight as I port this over from Notion to here.\u003c/p\u003e","title":""}]
